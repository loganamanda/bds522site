  I love my dogs Callie and Luna.

Description of my pets, 

* Callie is a 6 year old yellow lab
* Luna is 1 year old black lab 
* They both have brown eyes 
* Luna is more of a lunatic
* Callie is a loving, cuddly dog

My dogs favorite things to do,

1. Eat all the food they can have 
2. Go on long walks
3. Sun bathe on a cool day in the front yard
