When analyzing the data against a few crime variables, a few interesting observations were made. 

**Comparing murder rates in 2010 with stopped African Americans who were frisked in 2011** 

This analysis revealed that there was a significant effect for stopped African Americans frisks in the year 2011 based on the murder rates from 2010. The p-value for an African American being stopped/frisked was 0.0349 and the p-value for an African American being stopped/frisked based on the murder rates of 2010 was <2e-16. Therefore, one could infer that based on the murder rates in 2010, the likelihood of being stopped/frisked if African American in 2011, was significantly greater than the previous years. 

**Comparing murder rates in 2010 with stopped females who were frisked in 2011** 

This analysis revealed two significant p-values for this regression. The regression looked at murder rates from the year 2010 and compared them to the amount of female stops/frisks in the year following the murder rates. The p-value for females stopped and frisked in 2011 was 6.46e-09 and the p-value for the females stopped and frisked in 2011 to the murder rates in 2010 was 2.25e-11. Based on ths analysis, it appears as if the rate at which females were stopped/frisked went up based on the murder rates in the previous years.
